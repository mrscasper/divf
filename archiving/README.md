# Dawn Archiving Script

This script helps with archiving directories on Dawn from the fast working
disks, to the slower (read only) archiving disks.

## Getting Started

Put this script somewhere on your path.  It needs to be run on a server that 
can see all the directories concerned (mifs is a good example).

### Prerequisites

Python

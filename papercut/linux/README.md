# Linux Papercut Installation Script

Run this script on a Linux host as superuser, to install the printer driver
and the papercut_mono and papercut_colour queues.

It's known to work on Ubuntu and CentOS, but as its only dependency is 
CUPS, it should work on any Linux distribution.

## Getting Started

Example:

```
cp installpapercut /tmp
cd /tmp
sudo sh ./installpapercut
```
